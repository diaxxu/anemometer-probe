# Retractable Wind Probe 
![Deployed View](/PHOTO.png)</br>
This is a mechanical design of a wind probe system that can retract and hide itself inside a box-like structure. It includes a gear and rack mechanism to raise and lower the anemometer. The side panels rotate to allow deployment.

## Features

- Anemometer mounted on a vertical shaft
- Rack and pinion mechanism for vertical motion
- Two hinged side panels that open for deployment
- Enclosure that protects the system when retracted

## Use Cases

This system is intended for projects where wind measurement is needed but the sensor must be protected or hidden when not in use.

## How It Works

1. The user or motor drives the pinion gear to move the rack vertically.
2. The anemometer rises through the top of the enclosure.
3. Side panels open to allow wind to reach the sensor.
4. To retract, the gear lowers the shaft and the side panels close.

## Notes

- All parts were modeled in Fusion 360.
- The model is intended for 3D printing 
- Further integration with electronics is possible.
